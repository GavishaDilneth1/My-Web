        <h4>Robots in Industry : Key advancements in Industries Automation</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Key advancements in industrial automation include the increasing adoption of collaborative robots (cobots) that work alongside humans, enhancing both efficiency and safety. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also driving advancements, enabling systems to learn from data, adapt to changing environments, and make more informed decisions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) allows for real-time data collection and analysis, providing insights into process performance and enabling predictive maintenance. These advancements, along with digital transformation initiatives, are transforming industrial automation into a more flexible, efficient, and data-driven field.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Humanoids are robots that resemble and behave like the human body. They’re not only made to mimic our body form but also to act in areas originally meant for humans.</p>
        <p>Humanoid robots are available in diverse configurations tailored to their locomotion and intended application. The major categories include leg‐based humanoids well adapted to more dynamic environments and wheel‐based robots that are optimized for flat, stable ground.</p>
